## Chat wall

This is a very simple (almost tutorial) application in [Merb](http://merbivore.com/) framework taken from this [SLAPP tutorial](http://www.socialface.com/slapp/) . 

A little bit of additional AJAX & theming was added. 

Some shortcuts:

* `rake db:migrate` to generate database (*sqlite3* config by default)
* `rake spec` to run the tests
* `merb -t` interactive merb console
* `rake db:create:all` create databases for all configurations
* `rake db:test:clone` recreate the test database from the current database
